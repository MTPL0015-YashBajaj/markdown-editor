# Markdown Editors

This project consists of two simple markdown editors implemented using React. Each editor provides a real-time preview of the markdown content, but they use different libraries to render the markdown.

## Features

- **Editor 1**: Uses `react-markdown` to render markdown content.
- **Editor 2**: Uses `marked` to convert markdown to HTML and display it.

## Functionality

### Editor 1: `react-markdown`

- **Description**: This editor uses the `react-markdown` library to render markdown content. It provides a clean and straightforward way to view markdown text as formatted HTML.
- **How It Works**: 
  - Type or paste markdown content into the textarea.
  - The content is rendered in real-time in the preview pane using the `react-markdown` library.
- **Features**:
  - Supports standard markdown syntax including headers, lists, links, and images.
  - Live preview updates as you type.

### Editor 2: `marked`

- **Description**: This editor utilizes the `marked` library to convert markdown text into HTML. The HTML is then injected into the preview pane.
- **How It Works**:
  - Type or paste markdown content into the textarea.
  - The content is converted to HTML using the `marked` library and rendered in the preview pane.
- **Features**:
  - Supports a wide range of markdown syntax.
  - Preview updates in real-time based on the markdown input.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MTPL0015-YashBajaj/markdown-editor.git


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
